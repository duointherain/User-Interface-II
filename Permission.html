  <p>Gael and Jack are a couple of my favorite characters! Their story is 'The Moon's Permission'. Ultimately, it will cover 1915 through 1974. I've been working on this story for nearly three years and I'd like to say that I've gotten farther than I have, but some is better than none.</p>
  <p>There are 48 chapters up on tapas. You can read them at <a href="www.themoonspermission.com" target="_blank" alt="link to The Moon's Permission Website"></a>The Moon's Permission</a></p>

  <p>I'm also working on rewrites with more details and some NSFW parts, which will go up on my <a href ="https://vocal.media/authors/max-maxwell" target="_blank" alt="link to Max's Vocal account"> vocal
  </a> account, in small bit sized pieces. They should all work as stand alones, but connect together like building blocks.</p>
